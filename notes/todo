1. process all metrics (Ax,Ay..Gx...)
2. Can we do the preprocessing too? Like outliers detection and replace with mean, missing data handling, and NA 
3. Real time analysis without using CSV at all
4. tic-toc

add logging
add exception handling
add documentation
close influxdb connection?
write point in batches


prerequisite
  folders raw, preprocessed in the location where you download the given file
  influxdbs : test1, preprocessed
every 30 secs
  start time is noted
  extracts the data from influxdb(test1.Ax) pushing to csv in raw folder
  preprocessing is done( to be change as per your need)
  preprocessed data is stored in preprocessed folder, with the noted start time
  preprocessed data from preprocessed folder is pushed to influxdb(preprocessed.Ax)
  
  base config and env specifc extended config
  
  
  @ max what would be time window data needs to be fetched from raw data db? For example if we are taking 5 mins of Ax, with 70Hz will generate 2M datapoints
